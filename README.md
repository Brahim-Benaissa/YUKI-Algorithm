# YUKI-Algorithm MATLAB

YUKI algorithm is a metaheuristic search algorithm that dynamically reduces the search space by creating a local search area around the best solution found so far, adjusting the size of the area based on the distance between the absolute best point and the mean of the best points. The algorithm splits the search into two parts, with one part exploring outside the local search area and the other focusing on searching around the center of the search area. The exploration population moves away from the MeanBest point, and the rest of the population searches around the local area center. The fitness function used in this study of crack identification compares response vectors of suggested cracks to a reference response. The algorithm focuses the exploration effort in one direction and creates a pulsating effect by multiplying the MeanBest value by a random integer.
